Just some ideas I have about peer-to-peer, crowd-sourcing apps

The idea: Crowd-sourcing materials/tools on a click 
  -The expansion of our world has enabled us to explore and discover things to a degree that is unprecendented 
  -Exploration and discovery, however, involves tools and materials that may not be necessarily available
  -There are people out there who have what we need
  -Those who do have what we need may not necessarily need it at that point in time/don't use it all the time
  -Thus, how can we connect the materials/tools with the people who need it for that period of time
The inspiration: Airbnb (but for smaller things) 
Challenge: Guaranteeing the product goes to where it needs to go and then back
